abstract = {Cortical arousals are transient events of disturbed sleep that occur spontaneously or in response to stimuli such as apneic events. The gold standard for arousal detection in human polysomnographic recordings (PSGs) is manual annotation by expert human scorers, a method with significant interscorer variability. In this study, we developed an automated method, the Multimodal Arousal Detector (MAD), to detect arousals using deep learning methods. The MAD was trained on 2,889 PSGs to detect both cortical arousals and wakefulness in 1 second intervals. Furthermore, the relationship between MAD-predicted labels on PSGs and next day mean sleep latency (MSL) on a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), a reflection of daytime sleepiness, was analyzed in 1447 MSLT instances in 873 subjects. In a dataset of 1,026 PSGs, the MAD achieved a F1 score of 0.76 for arousal detection, while wakefulness was predicted with an accuracy of 0.95. In 60 PSGs scored by multiple human expert technicians, the MAD significantly outperformed the average human scorer for arousal detection with a difference in F1 score of 0.09. After controlling for other known covariates, a doubling of the arousal index was associated with an average decrease in MSL of 40 seconds ({\$}\backslashbeta{\$} = -0.67, p = 0.0075). The MAD outperformed the average human expert and the MAD-predicted arousals were shown to be significant predictors of MSL, which demonstrate clinical validity the MAD.},

This paper investigates the possibility of exploiting the multisource nature of the electrooculography (EOG) signals by presenting a method for automatic sleep staging using the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise algorithm, and a random forest classifier. It achieves a high overall accuracy of 82{\%} and a Cohen's kappa of 0.74 indicating substantial agreement between automatic and manual scoring.},

abstract = {Analysis of sleep for the diagnosis of sleep disorders such as Type-1 Narcolepsy (T1N) currently requires visual inspection of polysomnography records by trained scoring technicians. Here, we used neural networks in approximately 3,000 normal and abnormal sleep recordings to automate sleep stage scoring, producing a hypnodensity graph-a probability distribution conveying more information than classical hypnograms. Accuracy of sleep stage scoring was validated in 70 subjects assessed by six scorers. The best model performed better than any individual scorer (87{\%} versus consensus). It also reliably scores sleep down to 5 s instead of 30 s scoring epochs. A T1N marker based on unusual sleep stage overlaps achieved a specificity of 96{\%} and a sensitivity of 91{\%}, validated in independent datasets. Addition of HLA-DQB1*06:02 typing increased specificity to 99{\%}. Our method can reduce time spent in sleep clinics and automates T1N diagnosis. It also opens the possibility of diagnosing T1N using home sleep studies.},
