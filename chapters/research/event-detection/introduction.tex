This chapter presents the methods developed for detection of sleep events.
Specifically, the \ac{MSED} algorithm originally published in~\cite{Olesen2019} for arousal and limb movement detection is presented first in~\cref{sec:paperiv}, which is then followed by the updated version. A method for improving single-\ac{EEG} arousal detection is also included in~\cref{sec:paperv}. The chapter will conclude with a summary and discussion of the main findings of the individual research items in~\cref{sec:eventdetection-summary}.

\section{Research background}

As described in~\cref{chap:clinical-background}, correct diagnosis of sleep disorders is predicated on precise scoring of sleep stages as well as accurate scoring of these discrete sleep events. 
However, the current gold standard of manual analysis by experienced technicians is inherently biased and inconsistent and several studies have shown low inter-rater reliability on both the scoring of sleep stages~\cite{Norman2000,Rosenberg2013,Younes2016}, arousals~\cite{Bonnet2007}, and respiratory events~\cite{Rosenberg2014}. 
Furthermore, manual analysis of \acsp{PSG} is time-consuming and prone to scorer fatigue. 
Thus, there is a need for efficient systems that provide deterministic and reliable scorings of sleep studies.

Several recent studies have already explored automatic classification of sleep stages in large cohorts with good results~\cite{Olesen2018,Stephansen2018,Chambon2018a,Biswal2018, Phan2018}, however, the reliable and consistent detection and classification of discrete PSG events in large cohorts remain largely unexplored. 

Recent studies on certain micro-events in sleep have indicated that sleep spindles and K-complexes can be reliably detected and annotated with start time and duration using deep learning methods~\cite{Chambon2018b,Chambon2019}. 
Specifically, these studies proposed a single-shot event detection algorithm, that parallels the YOLO and SSD algorithms used for object detection in 2D images~\cite{Redmon2016,Liu2016}, however, they were limited in scope by detecting events only at the \ac{EEG} level, and did not explicitly take advantage of the temporal connection of the detected events. 
Additionally, experiments were carried out on a small-scale database~\cite{Chambon2018b}. 

Designing reliable and robust systems for automated sleep analysis based on machine learning algorithms often require multiple heterogenous data sources of sufficient size.
However, due to differences in clinical practice, very few datasets in sleep science are standardized with regards to recording setups despite guidelines from the \ac{AASM}.

In these cases, we end up with a \textit{channel mismatch problem}, in which the overlap between our source and target domains is small, and the domains are possibly disjointed. 
Recent studies have investigated the use of deep transfer learning to solve the channel mismatch problem when training and testing sleep stage classification models~\cite{Phan2019, Phan2019c}.
The authors found that using a fine-tuning strategy significantly improved the performance of sleep stage scoring models when trained on various combinations of \ac{EEG} and \ac{EOG} channels.
