This chapter aims to build upon the knowledge and methods introduced previously by applying them in a clinical setting.
Specifically, I will describe how we applied one of the sleep stage classification algorithms introduced in~\cref{chap:sleep-stage-classification} to identify patients with narcolepsy, which is a sleep disorder characterized by a dysfunctional regulation of the sleep-wake switch described in~\cref{sec:control-sleep}.

\section{Research background}

Sleep disorders and sleep dysregulation impact over \num{100} million Americans by contributing to a range of cardiovascular, metabolic and psychiatric disorders, such as obesity, diabetes, and depression. 
Generalized sleep deprivation also negatively impairs performance, judgment, and mood, and is a major preventable contributor to motor-vehicle-related accidents~\cite{Findley1988}.
There are approximately 90 different sleep disorders currently recognized and described in the \ac{ICSD} grouped into six categories: insomnias, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, central hypersomnias (\eg narcolepsy), sleep-related breathing disorders (\eg obstructive sleep apnea), parasomnias (\eg sleepwalking, \ac{RBD}), and sleep-related movement disorders (\eg \ac{PLMD} and restless legs syndrome)~\cite{AmericanAcademyofSleepMedicine2014}.%\graffito{The prevalences of insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome are estimated to be approximately \SIlist{20;10;4}{\percent} of the population, respectively.}, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, \ac{RBD}, and hypersomnia syndromes such as \ac{NT1}~\cite{AmericanAcademyofSleepMedicine2014}.

Among these pathologies, \ac{NT1} is unique as a disorder with a known, discrete pathophysiology---a destruction of hypocretin neurons in the hypothalamus, which is most likely of autoimmune origin~\cite{Peyron2000, Mignot2002, Kornum2020}.
This is reflected in the \ac{CSF} concentrations of the hypocretin-1 neuropeptide\graffito{Hypocretin-1 is also known as orexin-A.}, where a concentration below \SI{110}{\pico\gram\per\milli\liter} is considered indicative of narcolepsy~\cite{AmericanAcademyofSleepMedicine2014}\graffito{Although debated, there is also a narcolepsy type 2, which does not exhibit low \ac{CSF} hypocretin levels~\cite{Fronczek2020}.}. 

Typically beginning in childhood or adolescence, narcolepsy affects approximately \SI{0.03}{\percent} of the US, European, Korean and Chinese populations~\cite{Kornum2017}.
Unique to narcolepsy is the extremely strong association with the genetic marker \hla~\cite{Han2014}, and a well-characterized set of sleep disturbances that include short sleep latency, rapid transitions into \ac{REM} sleep and poor nocturnal sleep consolidation.
The pathology also includes episodes of \textit{sleep-wake dissociations}, where the neuron groups in the sleep-wake or \ac{REM}-\ac{NREM} switches fire at the wrong time.
This results in the clinical manifestations shown with parentheses in~\cref{fig:clinical-background:flipflop}.

    \end{adjustwidth*}
\end{figure}

The differentiation of sleep stages is also particularly important for the diagnosis of narcolepsy.
Current diagnostic guidelines for \ac{NT1} require a full-night \ac{PSG} and a \ac{MSLT} the following day, where patients are asked to nap \numrange{4}{5} times for \SI{20}{\minute} every \SI{2}{\hour} during the daytime, and for each nap, the sleep latency and \ac{REM} latency are noted~\cite{Littner2005}.
A \ac{MSL} less than \SI{8}{\minute}\graffito{A \ac{MSL} less than \SI{8}{\minute} is indicative of excessive sleepiness} and the presence of at least \num{2} \acp{SOREMP}\graffito{A \ac{SOREMP} is defined as \ac{REM} latency less than \SI{15}{\minute} following sleep onset in a nap.} during the \ac{MSLT}, or \num{1} \ac{SOREMP} plus a \ac{REM} latency less than \SI{15}{\minute} during nocturnal \ac{PSG} are diagnostic criteria for \ac{NT1}~\cite{AmericanAcademyofSleepMedicine2014}.
In a recent large study of the \ac{MSLT}, specificity and sensitivity for \ac{NT1} were \SIlist{98.6;92.9}{\percent} in comparing \num{516} \ac{NT1} versus \num{516} controls, respectively; and \SIlist{71.2;93.4}{\percent} in comparing \num{122} \ac{NT1} cases versus \num{132} other hypersomnia cases, respectively~\cite{Andlauer2013}.
Similar sensitivities of \SIrange{75}{90}{\percent} and specificities of \SIrange{90}{98}{\percent} have been reported by others in large samples of hypersomnia cases versus \ac{NT1}~\cite{Mignot2002,Andlauer2012,Luca2013,Dauvilliers2004,Moscovitch1993}. 
The \ac{MSLT} is thus both highly specific and highly sensitive, making it incredibly valuable as a diagnostic tool. 

\subsection{Research motivation and objectives}

In \cref{sec:paperiii}, we saw how a sleep stage classification algorithm could be constructed to reliably classify sleep stages as well or better than human experts.
The results presented an interesting observation: sleep stage classification performance was unperturbed by existing sleep disorders, except in patients with narcolepsy.
Furthermore, when comparing the hypnodensities in patients with and without narcolepsy, the former exhibited a much more diffuse sleep architecture with less pronounced sleep-wake cycles and increased \ac{REM}/\ac{W}/\ac{N1} disassociation. 
This is illustrated in~\cref{fig:paperiii-figure03} where the bottom (top) trace shows a hypnodensity graph for a subject with (without) narcolepsy.

These findings motivated a novel research question with is directly associated with research hypothesis~\ref{hypothesis:sleep-disorders}\graffito{\ref{hypothesis:sleep-disorders}: \hypothesis\xspace sleep disorders.}: 
\newcommand{\questionSleepDisorders}{based on a single overnight \ac{PSG} recording, is it possible to diagnose narcolepsy with the same level of performance as the current clinical gold standard?}
\begin{enumerate}[label={\footnotesize\bfseries\scshape RQ~3.\arabic*}, ref={\bfseries\scshape RQ~3.\arabic*}]
    \item \questionSleepDisorders\label{question:sleep-disorders}
\end{enumerate}
% \begin{displayquote}
%     based on a single overnight \ac{PSG} recording, can we diagnose narcolepsy with the same level of performance as the current clinical gold standard?
% \end{displayquote}

Derived from the research hypothesis and associated question, the following objectives were formulated:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item the model should be capable of diagnosing narcolepsy from the hypnodensity representation of a \ac{PSG} study;
    \item the model should have comparable or higher level of performance as the gold standard \ac{PSG}-\ac{MSLT} combination.
\end{enumerate}

The following sections describe the steps taken to complete the posed objectives and answer the research question.

\clearpage\section{Chapter summary}

This chapter%
\graffito{\ref{hypothesis:sleep-disorders}: \hypothesis\xspace sleep disorders} %
concerned the use of signal processing and machine learning for the detection of sleep disorders, the topic of which directly relates to \ref{hypothesis:sleep-disorders}.
Specifically, we were interested in the following question: \questionSleepDisorders\xspace 

We designed a narcolepsy model using feature engineering and probabilistic machine learning models to classify \ac{NT1} patients with a \SI{91}{\percent} sensitivity and \SI{96}{\percent} specificity using a hypnodensity representation of a single, overnight \ac{PSG} recording, which is the same level as the current gold standard. 
By adding \hla typing, the specificity increased to 99\%.
