\chapter{Sleep stage classification}\label{chap:sleep-stage-classification}

This chapter presents methods and main findings in two published research papers and one submitted manuscript.

First, the problem of automated sleep stage classification is presented and associated research questions are formulated. Second, the first version of the multi-modal automatic sleep stage classification (MASSCv1) model is presented along with the preliminary results published in~\cite{Olesen2018c}. Third, the second, unpublished version of the MASSC (MASSCv2) is presented. Fourth, the STAGES model for sleep stage classification originally published in~\cite{Stephansen2018} is presented along with associated results. The chapter will conclude with a summary and discussion of the main findings of the individual papers.
