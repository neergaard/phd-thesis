\chapter*{Publications}%\graffito{This is just an early --~and currently ugly~-- test!}
The following publications have been published, accepted or submitted during my PhD and form the basis of this thesis.
% This might come in handy for PhD theses: some ideas and figures have appeared previously in the following publications:

%\noindent Put your publications from the thesis here. The packages \texttt{multibib} or \texttt{bibtopic} etc. can be used to handle multiple different bibliographies in your document.

\begin{refsection}[ownpubs]
    \small
    % \nocite{*} % is local to to the enclosing refsection
    \nocite{Olesen2018c,Stephansen2018,Olesen2019,Olesen2020AutomaticSetting, Olesen2020DeepDetection}
    \printbibliography[heading=none]
\end{refsection}

Furthermore, I have (co-)authored the following publications during my PhD, that do not form basis of this thesis.

\begin{refsection}[ownpubs]
    \small
    % \nocite{*} % is local to to the enclosing refsection
    \nocite{Olesen2018, Olesen2018a, Olesen2019a, Jacobsen2018, Carvelli2018, Cesari2018, Carvelli2020, Brink-Kjaer2018, Brink-Kjaer2019, Klok2018}
    \printbibliography[heading=none]
\end{refsection}

% \emph{Attention}: This requires a separate run of \texttt{bibtex} for your \texttt{refsection}, \eg, \texttt{ClassicThesis1-blx} for this file. You might also use \texttt{biber} as the backend for \texttt{biblatex}. See also \url{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/128196/problem-with-refsection}.
