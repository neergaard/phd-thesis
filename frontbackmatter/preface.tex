This thesis represents the collective work as a PhD student at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) as part of the North-Atlantic Research Collaboration between DTU, the Danish Center for Sleep Medicine, and Stanford University, and is submitted as partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at DTU.

The research presented in this thesis was carried out in the Biomedical Signal Processing Group at the Department of Electrical Engineering, DTU, between December 2016 and September 2017, as a visiting student researcher at Stanford University between October 2017 and June 2019, and in the Section for Digital Health at the Department of Health Technology, DTU, from August 2019 to April 2020 following the formation of the new health department.

Apart from engaging in pure research activities, the PhD studies also presented opportunities to engage as a teaching assistant at DTU, co-supervision of student projects, as well as participating and presenting in international conferences both technical and medical in nature.

The dissertation consists of this summary report, which is based on six research papers and manuscripts written in the period 2016 to 2020. 
Four of them have been published or accepted for publication, one is currently under review, and the last is currently in preparation.
