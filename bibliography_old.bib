abstract = {Background Type 1 narcolepsy (NT1) is characterized by symptoms believed to represent Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep stage dissociations, occurrences where features of wake and REM sleep are intermingled, resulting in a mixed state. We hypothesized that sleep stage dissociations can be objectively detected through the analysis of nocturnal Polysomnography (PSG) data, and that those affecting REM sleep can be used as a diagnostic feature for narcolepsy. New method A Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model using 38 features extracted from EOG, EMG and EEG was used in control subjects to select features differentiating wake, stage N1, N2, N3 and REM sleep. Sleep stage differentiation was next represented in a 2D projection. Features characteristic of sleep stage differences were estimated from the residual sleep stage probability in the 2D space. Using this model we evaluated PSG data from NT1 and non-narcoleptic subjects. An LDA classifier was used to determine the best separation plane. Comparison with existing methods This method replicates the specificity/sensitivity from the training set to the validation set better than many other methods. Results Eight prominent features could differentiate narcolepsy and controls in the validation dataset. Using a composite measure and a specificity cut off 95{\%} in the training dataset, sensitivity was 43{\%}. Specificity/sensitivity was 94{\%}/38{\%} in the validation set. Using hypersomnia subjects, specificity/sensitivity was 84{\%}/15{\%}. Analyzing treated narcoleptics the specificity/sensitivity was 94{\%}/10{\%}. Conclusion Sleep stage dissociation can be used for the diagnosis of narcolepsy. However the use of some medications and presence of undiagnosed hypersomnolence patients impacts the result.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Type 1 narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep fragmentation, and cataplexy. Short rapid eye movement (REM) latency (≤15 min) during nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) or during naps of the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) defines a sleep-onset REM sleep period (SOREMP), a diagnostic hallmark. We hypothesized that abnormal sleep transitions other than SOREMPs can be identified in type 1 narcolepsy. METHODS Sleep-stage transitions (one to 10 epochs to one to five epochs of any other stage) and bout length features (one to 10 epochs) were extracted from PSGs. The first 15 min of sleep were excluded when a nocturnal SOREMP was recorded. F(0.1) measures and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to identify specific (≥98{\%}) features. A data set of 136 patients and 510 sex- and age-matched controls was used for the training. A data set of 19 cases and 708 sleep-clinic patients was used for the validation. RESULTS (1) ≥5 transitions from ≥5 epochs of stage N1 or W to ≥2 epochs of REM sleep, (2) ≥22 transitions from ≥3 epochs of stage N2 or N3 to ≥2 epochs of N1 or W, and (3) ≥16 bouts of ≥6 epochs of N1 or W were found to be highly specific (≥98{\%}). Sensitivity ranged from 16{\%} to 30{\%}, and it did not vary substantially with and without medication or a nocturnal SOREMP. In patients taking antidepressants, nocturnal SOREMPs occurred much less frequently (16{\%} vs. 36{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Increased sleep-stage transitions notably from ≥2.5 min of W/N1 into REM are specifically diagnostic for narcolepsy independent of a nocturnal SOREMP.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To measure the effect of age on Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT)characteristics, sleep latency, and number of sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMP) in two large populations of narcoleptic patients with similar genetic backgrounds. METHODS Clinical and polygraphic information on the severity of the condition was obtained on 236 well-defined narcolepsy-cataplexy-human leukocyte antigen DR2-positive patients from Montpellier (France) and on 147 similar patients from Montreal (Canada). RESULTS The results show a progressive decrease in the number of SOREMP with age and a progressive increase in the mean sleep latency on the MSLT as a function of age. This finding is also related to the severity of cataplexy as assessed from the clinical history with a progressive decrease in the frequency of cataplexy attacks with age. These results may reflect the progressive increase in sleep latency seen in normal aging and suggest that clinical improvement might be due to changes in the neural mechanisms responsible for SOREMP, which may weaken with age. CONCLUSIONS The progressive decrease in the number of SOREMP and increase in the mean sleep latency on the MSLT as a function of age suggest that the current criteria used for diagnosis may be too stringent in older patients. The major influence of age on MSLT results should therefore be taken into account when diagnosing a narcoleptic patient.},

The subgroup defined by a history of cataplexy was the most homogeneous in clinical and polygraphic variables. However, only 83{\%} of these subjects had two or more SOREMPs in one MSLT. The subgroup defined by two or more SOREMPs included many patients without cataplexy. A disproportionate number of these subjects were older women whose chances of developing cataplexy are remote. This group of older women had a higher number of periodic leg movements during sleep than the other groups. Patients with both cataplexy and two or more SOREMPs have the greatest chance of being DR2 DQw1 positive. Thus, the combination of history of cataplexy and two or more SOREMPs is the best clinical determinant of narcolepsy. However, two or more SOREMPs is a poorer discriminant of narcolepsy than history of cataplexy.},

SETTINGS China (Peking University People's Hospital), Czech Republic (Charles University), Denmark (Golstrup Hospital), Italy (University of Bologna), Korea (Catholic University), and USA (Stanford University). DESIGN CSF hypocretin-1, DQB1*06:02, clinical and polysomnographic data were collected in narcolepsy patients (552 with and 144 without cataplexy) from 6 sites. Numbers of cases with and without DQB1*06:02 and low CSF hypocretin-1 were compiled. HLA class I (A, B, C), class II (DRBs, DQA1, DQB1, DPA1, and DPB1), and whole exome sequencing were conducted in 9 DQB1*06:02 negative cases with low CSF hypocretin-1. Sanger sequencing of selected exons in DNMT1, HCRT, and MOG was performed to exclude mutations in known narcolepsy-associated genes. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS Classic narcolepsy markers DQB1*06:02 and low CSF hypocretin-1 were found in 87.4{\%} of cases with cataplexy, and in 20.0{\%} without cataplexy. Nine cases (all with cataplexy) were DQB1*06:02 negative with low CSF hypocretin-1, constituting 1.7{\%} [0.8{\%}-3.4{\%}] of all cases with cataplexy and 1.8{\%} [0.8{\%}-3.4{\%}] of cases with low CSF hypocretin independent of cataplexy across sites. Five HLA negative subjects had severe cataplexy, often occurring without clear triggers. Subjects had diverse ethnic backgrounds and HLA alleles at all loci, suggesting no single secondary HLA association. The rare subtype DPB1*0901, and homologous DPB1*10:01 subtype, were present in 5 subjects, suggesting a secondary association with HLA-DP. Preprohypocretin sequencing revealed no mutations beyond one previously reported in a very early onset case. No new MOG or DNMT1 mutations were found, nor were suspicious or private variants in novel genes identified through exome sequencing. CONCLUSIONS Hypocretin, MOG, or DNMT1 mutations are exceptional findings in DQB1*06:02 negative cases with hypocretin deficiency. A secondary HLA-DP association may be present in these cases. These represent particularly difficult diagnostic challenges.},

abstract = {Astute control of brain activity states is critical for adaptive behaviours and survival. In mammals and birds, electroencephalographic recordings reveal alternating states of wakefulness, slow wave sleep and paradoxical sleep (or rapid eye movement sleep). This control is profoundly impaired in narcolepsy with cataplexy, a disease resulting from the loss of orexin/hypocretin neurotransmitter signalling in the brain. Narcolepsy with cataplexy is characterized by irresistible bouts of sleep during the day, sleep fragmentation during the night and episodes of cataplexy, a sudden loss of muscle tone while awake and experiencing emotions. The neural mechanisms underlying cataplexy are unknown, but commonly thought to involve those of rapid eye movement-sleep atonia, and cataplexy typically is considered as a rapid eye movement sleep disorder. Here we reassess cataplexy in hypocretin (Hcrt, also known as orexin) gene knockout mice. Using a novel video/electroencephalogram double-blind scoring method, we show that cataplexy is not a state per se, as believed previously, but a dynamic, multi-phased process involving a reproducible progression of states. A knockout-specific state and a stereotypical paroxysmal event were introduced to account for signals and electroencephalogram spectral characteristics not seen in wild-type littermates. Cataplexy almost invariably started with a brief phase of wake-like electroencephalogram, followed by a phase featuring high-amplitude irregular theta oscillations, defining an activity profile distinct from paradoxical sleep, referred to as cataplexy-associated state and in the course of which 1.5-2 s high-amplitude, highly regular, hypersynchronous paroxysmal theta bursts (∼7 Hz) occurred. In contrast to cataplexy onset, exit from cataplexy did not show a predictable sequence of activities. Altogether, these data contradict the hypothesis that cataplexy is a state similar to paradoxical sleep, even if long cataplexies may evolve into paradoxical sleep. Although not exclusive to overt cataplexy, cataplexy-associated state and hypersynchronous paroxysmal theta activities are highly enriched during cataplexy in hypocretin/orexin knockout mice. Their occurrence in an independent narcolepsy mouse model, the orexin/ataxin 3 transgenic mouse, undergoing loss of orexin neurons, was confirmed. Importantly, we document for the first time similar paroxysmal theta hypersynchronies (∼4 Hz) during cataplexy in narcoleptic children. Lastly, we show by deep recordings in mice that the cataplexy-associated state and hypersynchronous paroxysmal theta activities are independent of hippocampal theta and involve the frontal cortex. Cataplexy hypersynchronous paroxysmal theta bursts may represent medial prefrontal activity, associated in humans and rodents with reward-driven motor impulse, planning and conflict monitoring.},

abstract = {Characterization of excessive sleepiness is an important task for the sleep clinician, and assessment requires a thorough history and in many cases, objective assessment in the sleep laboratory. These practice parameters were developed to guide the sleep clinician on appropriate clinical use of the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), and the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT). These recommendations replace those published in 1992 in a position paper produced by the American Sleep Disorders Association. A Task Force of content experts was appointed by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine to perform a comprehensive review of the scientific literature and grade the evidence regarding the clinical use of the MSLT and the MWT. Practice parameters were developed based on this review and in most cases evidence based methods were used to support recommendations. When data were insufficient or inconclusive, the collective opinion of experts was used to support recommendations. These recommendations were developed by the Standards of Practice Committee and reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The MSLT is indicated as part of the evaluation of patients with suspected narcolepsy and may be useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected idiopathic hypersomnia. The MSLT is not routinely indicated in the initial evaluation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, or in assessment of change following treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The MSLT is not routinely indicated for evaluation of sleepiness in medical and neurological disorders (other than narcolepsy), insomnia, or circadian rhythm disorders. The MWT may be indicated in assessment of individuals in whom the inability to remain awake constitutes a safety issue, or in patients with narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia to assess response to treatment with medications. There is little evidence linking mean sleep latency on the MWT with risk of accidents in real world circumstances. For this reason, the sleep clinician should not rely solely on mean sleep latency as a single indicator of impairment or risk for accidents, but should also rely on clinical judgment. Assessment should involve integration of findings from the clinical history, compliance with treatment, and, in some cases, objective testing using the MWT. These practice parameters also include recommendations for the MSLT and MWT protocols, a discussion of the normative data available for both tests, and a description of issues that need further study.},

abstract = {Narcolepsy is characterized by abnormal sleep-wake regulation, causing sleep episodes during the day and nocturnal sleep disruptions. The transitions between sleep and wakefulness can be identified by manual scorings of a polysomnographic recording. The aim of this study was to develop an automatic classifier capable of separating sleep epochs from epochs of wakefulness by using EEG measurements from one channel. Features from frequency bands $\alpha$ (0-4 Hz), $\beta$ (4-8 Hz), $\delta$ (8-12 Hz), $\theta$ (12-16 Hz), 16 to 24 Hz, 24 to 32 Hz, 32 to 40 Hz, and 40 to 48 Hz were extracted from data by use of a wavelet packet transformation and were given as input to a support vector machine classifier. The classification algorithm was assessed by hold-out validation and 10-fold cross-validation. The data used to validate the classifier were derived from polysomnographic recordings of 47 narcoleptic patients (33 with cataplexy and 14 without cataplexy) and 15 healthy controls. Compared with manual scorings, an accuracy of 90{\%} was achieved in the hold-out validation, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 95{\%}. Sensitivity and specificity were 90{\%} and 88{\%}, respectively. The 10-fold cross-validation procedure yielded an accuracy of 88{\%}, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 92{\%}, a sensitivity of 87{\%}, and a specificity of 87{\%}. Narcolepsy with cataplexy patients experienced significantly more sleep-wake transitions during night than did narcolepsy without cataplexy patients (P = 0.0199) and healthy subjects (P = 0.0265). In addition, the sleep-wake transitions were elevated in hypocretin-deficient patients. It is concluded that the classifier shows high validity for identifying the sleep-wake transition. Narcolepsy with cataplexy patients have more sleep-wake transitions during night, suggesting instability in the sleep-wake regulatory system.},

SETTING: Sleep laboratory. PATIENTS: One hundred seventy-five patients with hypocretin-deficient narcolepsy type 1 (NT1, n = 79), narcolepsy type 2 (NT2, n = 22), idiopathic hypersomnia (IH, n = 22), and "subjective" hypersomnolence (sHS, n = 52). INTERVENTIONS: None. METHODS: Polysomnographic (PSG) work-up included 48 h of continuous PSG recording. From nocturnal PSG conventional sleep macrostructure, occurrence of sleep onset rapid eye movement period (SOREMP), sleep stages distribution, and sleep stage transitions were calculated. Patient groups were compared, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to test the diagnostic utility of nocturnal PSG data to identify NT1. RESULTS: Sleep macrostructure was substantially stable in the 2 nights of each diagnostic group. NT1 and NT2 patients had lower latency to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and NT1 patients showed the highest number of awakenings, sleep stage transitions, and more time spent in N1 sleep, as well as most SOREMPs at daytime PSG and at multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) than all other groups. ROC curve analysis showed that nocturnal SOREMP (area under the curve of 0.724 +/- 0.041, P {\textless} 0.0001), percent of total sleep time spent in N1 (0.896 +/- 0.023, P {\textless} 0.0001), and the wakefulness-sleep transition index (0.796 +/- 0.034, P {\textless} 0.0001) had a good sensitivity and specificity profile to identify NT1 sleep, especially when used in combination (0.903 +/- 0.023, P {\textless} 0.0001), similarly to SOREMP number at continuous daytime PSG (0.899 +/- 0.026, P {\textless} 0.0001) and at MSLT (0.956 +/- 0.015, P {\textless} 0.0001).

SETTING: University-based sleep clinics and laboratories. PATIENTS: Narcolepsy without cataplexy (n = 171) and control patients (n = 170), all with available CSF hypocretin-1. DESIGN AND INTERVENTIONS: Retrospective comparison and receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. Patients were also recontacted to evaluate if they developed cataplexy by survival curve analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The optimal cutoff of CSF hypocretin-1 for narcolepsy without cataplexy diagnosis was 200 pg/ml rather than 110 pg/ml (sensitivity 33{\%}, specificity 99{\%}). Forty-one patients (24{\%}), all HLA DQB1*06:02 positive, had low concentrations ({\textless}/= 110 pg/ml) of CSF hypocretin-1. Patients with low concentrations of hypocretin-1 only differed subjectively from other groups by a higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale score and more frequent sleep paralysis. Compared with patients with normal hypocretin-1 concentration (n = 117, 68{\%}), those with low hypocretin-1 concentration had higher HLA DQB1*06:02 frequencies, were more frequently non-Caucasians (notably African Americans), with lower age of onset, and longer duration of illness. They also had more frequently short rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep latency ({\textless}/= 15 min) during polysomnography (64{\%} versus 23{\%}), and shorter sleep latencies (2.7 +/- 0.3 versus 4.4 +/- 0.2 min) and more sleep-onset REM periods (3.6 +/- 0.1 versus 2.9 +/- 0.1 min) during the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). Patients with intermediate concentrations of CSF hypocretin-1 (n = 13, 8{\%}) had intermediate HLA DQB1*06:02 and polysomnography results, suggesting heterogeneity. Of the 127 patients we were able to recontact, survival analysis showed that almost half (48{\%}) with low concentration of CSF hypocretin-1 had developed typical cataplexy at 26 yr after onset, whereas only 2{\%} had done so when CSF hypocretin-1 concentration was normal. Almost all patients (87{\%}) still complained of daytime sleepiness independent of hypocretin status. CONCLUSION: Objective (HLA typing, MSLT, and sleep studies) more than subjective (sleepiness and sleep paralysis) features predicted low concentration of CSF hypocretin-1 in patients with narcolepsy without cataplexy.},

abstract = {CONTEXT Narcolepsy, a neurological disorder affecting 1 in 2000 individuals, is associated with HLA-DQB1*0602 and low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin (orexin) levels. OBJECTIVES To delineate the spectrum of the hypocretin deficiency syndrome and to establish CSF hypocretin-1 measurements as a diagnostic tool for narcolepsy. DESIGN Diagnosis, HLA-DQ, clinical data, the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and CSF hypocretin-1 were studied in a case series of patients with sleep disorders from 1999 to 2002. Signal detection analysis was used to determine the CSF hypocretin-1 levels best predictive for International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD)-defined narcolepsy (blinded criterion standard). Clinical and demographic features were compared in narcoleptic subjects with and without low CSF hypocretin-1 levels. SETTING Sleep disorder and neurology clinics in the United States and Europe, with biological testing performed at Stanford University, Stanford, Calif. PARTICIPANTS There were 274 patients with narcolepsy; hypersomnia; obstructive sleep apnea; restless legs syndrome; insomnia; and atypical hypersomnia cases such as familial cases, narcolepsy without cataplexy or without HLA-DQB1*0602, recurrent hypersomnias, and symptomatic cases (eg, Parkinson disease, depression, Prader-Willi syndrome, Niemann-Pick disease type C). The subject group also included 296 controls (healthy and with neurological disorders). INTERVENTION Venopuncture for HLA typing, lumbar puncture for CSF analysis, primary diagnosis using the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Stanford Sleep Inventory for evaluation of narcolepsy, and sleep recording studies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Diagnostic threshold for CSF hypocretin-1, HLA-DQB1*0602 positivity, and clinical and polysomnographic features. RESULTS HLA-DQB1*0602 frequency was increased in narcolepsy with typical cataplexy (93{\%} vs 17{\%} in controls), narcolepsy without cataplexy (56{\%}), and in essential hypersomnia (52{\%}). Hypocretin-1 levels below 110 pg/mL were diagnostic for narcolepsy. Values above 200 pg/mL were considered normal. Most subjects with low levels were HLA-DQB1*0602-positive narcolepsy-cataplexy patients. These patients did not always have abnormal MSLT. Rare subjects without cataplexy, DQB1*0602, and/or with secondary narcolepsy had low levels. Ten subjects with hypersomnia had intermediate levels, 7 with narcolepsy (often HLA negative, of secondary nature, and/or with atypical cataplexy or no cataplexy), and 1 with periodic hypersomnia. Healthy controls and subjects with other sleep disorders all had normal levels. Neurological subjects had generally normal levels (n = 194). Intermediate (n = 30) and low (n = 3) levels were observed in various acute neuropathologic conditions. CONCLUSIONS Narcolepsy-cataplexy with hypocretin deficiency is a genuine disease entity. Measuring CSF hypocretin-1 is a definitive diagnostic test, provided that it is interpreted within the clinical context. It may be most useful in cases with cataplexy and when the MSLT is difficult to interpret (ie, in subjects already treated with psychoactive drugs or with other concurrent sleep disorders).},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES Characterize disrupted nighttime sleep (DNS) in narcolepsy, an important symptom of narcolepsy. METHODS A panel of international narcolepsy experts was convened in 2011 to build a consensus characterization of DNS in patients with narcolepsy. A literature search of the Medline (1965 to date), Medline In-Process (latest weeks), Embase (1974 to date), Embase Alert (latest 8 weeks), and Biosis (1965 to date) databases was conducted using the following search terms: narcolepsy and disrupted nighttime sleep, disturbed nighttime sleep, fragmented sleep, consolidated sleep, sleep disruption, and narcolepsy questionnaire. The purpose of the literature search was to identify publications characterizing the nighttime sleep of patients with narcolepsy. The panel reviewed the literature. Nocturnal sleep can also be disturbed by REM sleep abnormalities such as vivid dreaming and REM sleep behavior disorder; however, these were not reviewed in the current paper, as we were evaluating for idiopathic sleep disturbances. RESULTS The literature reviewed provide a consistent characterization of nighttime sleep in patients with narcolepsy as fragmented, with reports of frequent, brief nightly awakenings with difficulties returning to sleep and associated reports of poor sleep quality. Polysomnographic studies consistently report frequent awakenings/arousals after sleep onset, more stage 1 (S1) sleep, and more frequent shifts to S1 sleep or wake from deeper stages of sleep. The consensus of the International Experts' Panel on Narcolepsy was that DNS can be distressing for patients with narcolepsy and that treatment of DNS warrants consideration. CONCLUSIONS Clinicians involved in the management of patients with narcolepsy should investigate patients' quality of nighttime sleep, give weight and consideration to patient reports of nighttime sleep experience, and consider DNS a target for treatment.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To compare diurnal and nocturnal electrophysiological data from narcolepsy patients with undetectable ({\textless}20 pg/mL), low (20-110 pg/mL) and normal ({\textgreater}110 pg/mL) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 levels. PATIENTS/METHODS A total of 109 narcolepsy patients and 37 controls were studied; all had available CSF hypocretin-1 measurements. The sleep laboratory studies were conducted between 2008 and 2014. The study retrospectively examined measurements of sleep stage transitions in diurnal and nocturnal continuous polysomnography. The percentage distribution of time awake and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and the occurrence of sleep onset REM (SOREM) in the nocturnal polysomnography were also measured. RESULTS Participants with undetectable hypocretin-1 levels had significantly higher frequencies of transitions than controls and those with normal hypocretin-1 levels. Participants with low hypocretin-1 levels showed more transitions than controls and, in some cases, also more than those with normal hypocretin-1. Participants with normal hypocretin-1 failed to show any significant difference from the controls, except in the overall diurnal transitions. CONCLUSION Undetectable hypocretin-1 levels in particular, but also low hypocretin-1 levels, were associated with a less stable phenotype featuring more sleep state transitions and SOREM episodes. In addition, there was a distinction between nocturnal and diurnal REM sleep in hypocretin-deficient participants, expressed as increased diurnal REM sleep, which was not reflected in nocturnal sleep.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Discrimination between narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, and behavior-induced inadequate sleep syndrome (BIISS) is based on clinical features and on specific nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) results. However, previous studies have cast doubt on the specificity and sensitivity of these diagnostic tools. METHODS: Eleven variables of the NPSG were analyzed in 101 patients who were retrospectively diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy (N+C) (n=24), narcolepsy without cataplexy (N-C) (n=38), idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep period (IHL) (n=21), and BIISS (n=18). RESULTS: Fifteen out of 24 N+C and 8 out of 38 N-C entered the first rapid eye movement (REM) sleep period (FREMP) from sleep stage 1 (N1) or wake (W), though this sleep-stage sequence did not arise in the other patient groups. FREMP stage sequence was a function of REM sleep latency (REML) for both N+C and N-C groups. FREMP stage sequence was not associated with mean sleep latency (MSL) in N+C but was associated in N-C, which implies heterogeneity within the N-C group. REML also was a useful discriminator. Depending on the cutoff period, REML had a sensitivity and specificity of up to 85.5{\%} and 97.4{\%}, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The FREMP stage sequence may be a useful tool in the diagnosis of narcolepsy, particularly in conjunction with sleep-stage sequence analysis of sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs) in the MSLT; it also may provide a helpful intermediate phenotype in the clarification of heterogeneity in the N-C diagnostic group. However, larger prospective studies are necessary to confirm these findings.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To determine the diagnostic values, longitudinal stability, and HLA association of the sleep stage transitions in narcolepsy. METHODS To compare the baseline differences in the sleep stage transition to REM sleep among 35 patients with type 1 narcolepsy, 39 patients with type 2 narcolepsy, 26 unaffected relatives, and 159 non-narcoleptic sleep patient controls, followed by a reassessment at a mean duration of 37.4 months. RESULTS The highest prevalence of altered transition from stage non-N2/N3 to stage R in multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) was found in patients with type 1 narcolepsy (92.0{\%} and 57.1{\%}), followed by patients with type 2 narcolepsy (69.4{\%} and 12.8{\%}), unaffected relatives (46.2{\%} and 0{\%}), and controls (39.3{\%} and 1.3{\%}). Individual sleep variables had varied sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing narcolepsy. By incorporating a combination of sleep variables, the decision tree analysis improved the sensitivity to 94.3{\%} and 82.1{\%} and enhanced specificity to 82.4{\%} and 83{\%} for the diagnosis of type 1 and type 2 narcolepsy, respectively. There was a significant association of DBQ1*0602 with the altered sleep stage transition (OR = 16.0, 95{\%} CI: 1.7-149.8, p = 0.015). The persistence of the altered sleep stage transition in both MSLT and NPSG was high for both type 1 (90.5{\%} and 64.7{\%}) and type 2 narcolepsy (92.3{\%} and 100{\%}), respectively. CONCLUSION Altered sleep stage transition is a significant and stable marker of narcolepsy, which suggests a vulnerable wake-sleep dysregulation trait in narcolepsy. Altered sleep stage transition has a significant diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of hypersomnias, especially when combined with other diagnostic sleep variables in decision tree analysis.},
